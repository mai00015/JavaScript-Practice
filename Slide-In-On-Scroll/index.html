    <p>Let’s start by getting one thing clear: This belief is false. The problem here is not the amount of available hours, but rather how each hour is spent. I know this from firsthand experience. While researching this book, I spent time with some of the country’s most accomplished students, and I can assure you that no matter how diligent you think you are, there is a Rhodes scholar out there who fits in three times the amount of work and activities you do and probably still manages to party harder than you would ever dare.</p>
    <p>I don’t mean to imply that everyone should aim to become a drunken Rhodes scholar (though it would certainly be fun to try); rather, my point is that a surprising amount of work, relaxation, and socializing can be extracted from a single twelve-hour day.</p>
    <p>As humans, our minds have evolved to prefer short term tasks such as “run away from that lion” or “eat food.” Therefore, when you walk into the library on a Sunday morning with the goal of finishing all of your homework and writing a paper, your brain isn’t happy.</p> 
    <p>The idea of spending eight consecutive hours trapped in a study carrel is dispiriting. Plus, it’s hard to focus for that long, so pretty soon fatigue will set in, your concentration will wander, and every distraction will suddenly seem impossibly appealing.</p>
    <p>Before you know it, the day will be over and you’ll realize that you haven’t accomplished much productive work at all. The next day, new assignments will pile onto those you didn’t finish on Sunday, and the tedious process starts all over again.</p>

    <p>Why does this timing work the best? I don’t know exactly. Some cognitive science research concludes that about fifty minutes is the optimal learning period to maximize the material synthesized per time unit. Why does this timing work the best? I don’t know exactly. Some cognitive science research concludes that about fifty minutes is the optimal learning period to maximize the material synthesized per time unit. But we don’t have to get bogged down with these scientific details. And the list goes on, as response after response revealed a similar strategy.</p>

    <p>It’s not really their fault. When students arrive at college, they’re on their own. No one ever takes them aside to teach them the right way to study, so most students just make it up as they go along. For example, when an exam date looms, the typical student pulls out his books and notes and then cloisters himself in his dorm study lounge or at the desk in his room. At this point, he begins reviewing, almost at random, poring over as many notes and chapters as he can manage, with frequent breaks to converse with friends and check e-mail, until, finally, his will to continue completely flickers out. As shown in the scenario above, the typical student studies by performing rote review—the reading and rereading of assignments and notes as many times as possible. The idea behind this strategy is that somehow, if the material crosses before your eyes enough times, the key ideas will stick around long enough to be later regurgitated during the exam.</p>

    <p>The only exception, of course, is if your grade is in danger. If you’re in academic trouble, perhaps due to a poor performance on a previous exam or paper, then go all out in your review. <img src="http://unsplash.it/200/200" class="align-right slide-in"> If you apply the full force of the study strategies that follow, you will be guaranteed to knock any quiz out of the park. There is, however, one obvious exception to this laptop rule: For math, science, economics, and engineering courses that are heavy on numbers and equations, pencil and paper are acceptable. Some people are comfortable approximating complicated mathematical symbols on their laptop, while others are not. If you fall into the latter category, don’t worry about using a notebook; for a technical course, the difference between the two mediums is less important. A “nontechnical course” refers to any course outside of math, science, economics, and engineering. We’re talking about English, history, psychology, political science, anthropology, classics, education—basically anything that doesn’t make frequent use of mathematical formulas. These courses are the domain of ridiculously long reading assignments and dignified professors lecturing from behind a podium. Don’t be afraid to use aggressive text formatting to help emphasize important points. On a computer, smart students often make use of bold fontsand lists to help organize their thoughts.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that professors don’t always state the question. Often they jump right into the evidence and leave it to you to deduce the question being discussed. Don’t be afraid to jot down “QUESTION:” and then leave the rest of the line blank as you begin recording evidence. Once you figure out what the professor’s talking about, you can go back and fill in this blank.</p>

    <p>Something to remember: Conclusions are rarely simple. Professors often offer conclusions that only summarize the complexity of the issue. Consider, for example, the following question from a literature class: “Who was the greatest novelist of the twentieth century?” A simple conclusion might be: “Hemingway.” And the evidence, in this case, might be several points highlighting the influence and originality of Hemingway’s work.</p>

    <P>On the other hand, it’s much more likely that a college professor would offer up a more complicated conclusion to this question, perhaps something like: “Different generations answered this question differently, depending on the prevailing social issues of their time.” In this case, the evidence could be excerpts from scholars of various periods talking about their favorite novelists, as well as some observations concerning the differing social climates during each of these eras.</P>
